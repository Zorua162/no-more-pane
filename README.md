# no-more-pane
Remove the left pane from the panopto screen and increases the width of the right viewer
so that the video will fit to the left window doc much better.

This is a chrome extension so can be packed from:
chrome://extensions

To use this extension simply go to the panopto tab that you wish to have more space on and press
the extensions icon in the top right of your browser. This will remove the left pane and 
expand the right viewer so that once you shrink the window down to half size the viewer 
should sit in the center of the page.
